# Computer Networks @IITKGP-CSE

Welcome to my Computer Networks repository! Here you'll find the lecture slides, supplementary materials and my assignment submissions for the Computer Networks Theory and Lab courses, which was taken by me during the 6th semester of my studies, as part of the core subjects for the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IITKGP).
